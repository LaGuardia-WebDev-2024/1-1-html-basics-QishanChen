  </h1>
<p>Over hill, over dale,<br>
Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br>
Over park, over pale,<br>
Thorough flood, thorough fire!<br>
I do wander everywhere,<br>
Swifter than the moon's sphere;<br>
And I serve the Fairy Queen,<br>
To dew her orbs upon the green;<br>
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;<br>
In their gold coats spots you see;<br>
Those be rubies, fairy favours;<br>
In those freckles live their savours;<br>
I must go seek some dewdrops here,<br>
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
